description:  我们从Map generation和Map maintenance两个角度来对比SVO-SLAM和ORB-SLAM。
---

**Map generation**:The system proceeds by triangulating the 2D points of interest into 3D landmarks and keeps track of their 3D coordinates and then localizes the camera within what is referred to as a metric map.

 **Map maintenance**:

1.During a map exploration phase, new 3D landmarks are triangulated based on the camera pose estimates. After some time, system drift manifests itself in wrong camera pose measurements, due to accumulated errors in previous camera poses that were used to expand the map.

2.bundle adjustment or pose graph optimization.map point culling, keyframe culling and local bundle adjustment.

|optimizing the map through | some say LBA and GBA(eg. PTAM),over the entire map) is appropriate, while SVO argue that a local BA only is sufficient to maintain a good quality map.[6]| The local mapping thread also performs a local bundle adjustment over all keyframes connected to the latest accommodated keyframe in the co-visibility graph and all other keyframes that observe any landmark present in the current keyframe[7]( in addition, use pose graph optimization in loop closing[8])|
|detecting  outliers| no outliers removing.| A landmark must be cor- rectly matched to twenty five percent of the frames in which it is predicted to be visible. It also must be visible from at least three keyframes after more than one keyframe has been accommodated into the map since it was spawned. Other- wise, the landmark is removed.|
|culling keyframe| SVO’s map management maintains only a fixed number of keyframes in the map and removes distant ones when new keyframes are added. | keyframe culling procedure takes place as well. Keyframes that have ninety percent of their associated landmarks observed in three other keyframes are deemed redundant and removed|
|cons & pros|1.sensitive to lighting conditions of the scene, <br> 2.lost frame location should be close enough to the queried keyframe|suits in static & small or large enviroment|

**Appendix**：

[1]Topologicalmaps[9] were introduced to alleviate this short- coming, in an effort to minimize the metric information in the map by forfeiting geometric information (scale, distance and direction) in favor for connectivity information.
While topological maps scale well with large scenes, in order to maintain camera pose estimates, metric information is also required;  therefore recent Visual SLAM systems employ hybrid maps[10] that are locally metric and globally topological. hybrid map allows for local optimization of the metric map while maintaining scalability of the optimiza- tion over the global topological map .

[2] To reduce the computational expenses of bundle adjustment, Strasdat et al (2011) proposed to represent the visual SLAM map by both a Euclidean map for LBA, along with a topological map for pose graph optimization that explicitly distributes the accumulated drift along the entire map.

[3] The co-visibility graph is a pose graph that represents all keyframes in the system by nodes, in contrast to the essential graph that al- low every node to have two or less edges, by keeping the strongest two edges only for every node.

[4] filter-based landmark estimation techniques recover the position of a landmark by populating. particle filter with a uniform distribution (D1) of landmark position estimates, which are then updated as the landmark is observed across multiple views. This continues until the filter converges from a uniform distribution to a Gaussian with a small variance (D3). In this type of landmark estima- tion, outliers are easily flagged as landmarks whose distribution remain approximately uniform after significant observations.

[5] tracked images, projecting rays from two associated features will most probably not intersect in 3D space. Triangulation by optimization as (shown in Fig. 11) aims to estimate a land- mark pose corresponding to the associated features, by min- imizing its re-projection error e1and e2onto both frames

[6]Bundle adjustment (BA) is inherited from SfM and con- sists of a nonlinear optimization process for refining a vi- sual reconstruction, to jointly produce an optimal structure and coherent camera pose estimates. Bundle adjustment is computationally involved and intractable if performed on all frames and all poses. The breakthrough that enabled its ap- plication in PTAM is the notion of keyframes, where only select frames labeled as keyframes are used in the map cre- ation and passed to theb undle adjustment process in contrast to SfM methods that uses all available frames.

[7]To reduce the computational expenses of bundle adjustment, Strasdat et al (2011) proposed to represent the visual SLAM map by both a Euclidean map for LBA, along with a topological map for pose graph optimization that explicitly distributes the accumulated drift along the entire map.

[8]Pose Graph Optimization (PGO) returns inferior results to those produced by GBA. The reasons is that while PGO optimizes only for the keyframe poses–and accordingly ad- justs the 3D structure of landmarks–GBA jointly optimizes for both keyframe poses and 3D structure. The stated ad- vantage of GBA comes at the cost of computational time, with PGO exhibiting significant speed up compared to GBA.However, pose graph optimization requires efficient loop closure detection and may not yield an optimal result as the errors are distributed along the entire map, leading to lo- cally induced inaccuracies in regions that were not originally wrong.

[9]In the context of Visual SLAM, a topological map is an undirected graph of nodes that typically represents keyframes linked to- gether by edges, when shared data associations between the nodes exists.

[10]The implemen- tation of a hybrid map representation permits the system to (1) reason about the world on a high level, which allows for efficientsolutionstoloopclosuresandfailurerecoveryusing topological information, and (2) to increase efficiency of the metric pose estimate by limiting the scope of the map to a local region surrounding the camera.
